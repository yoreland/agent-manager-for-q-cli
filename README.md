## 📍 Agent Locations

### 📁 Local Agents (Workspace-Specific)
- **Location**: `.amazonq/cli-agents/` in your current workspace
- **Use Case**: Project-specific agents with workspace-relevant configurations
- **Scope**: Only available within the current VS Code workspace

### 🌍 Global Agents (User-Wide)
- **Location**: `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/` in your home directory

- **Scope**: Available in all VS Code workspaces

> **💡 Tip**: When both local and global agents have the same name, the local agent takes precedence.
